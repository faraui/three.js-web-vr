# three.js-web-vr
Web Virtual Reality (WebVR) 3D game template based on Three.js. Camera rotation can also be done with a mouse, as well as the character's movement can be done with WASD keys. Virtual reality hardware was tested only in a certain `Google Chrome` version from the year 2022.
 
Files `three.js` and `stats.js` were not written by me and are provided as given by their authors in certain versions from the year 2022. All the other files were written by me.

The project is abandoned for more than 2 years and there is no intentions of resuming work on it.
