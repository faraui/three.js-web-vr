# three.js-web-vr
  Web Virtual Reality (WebVR) 3D game template based on Three.js. Camera rotation can also be done with a mouse, as well as the character's movement can be done with WASD keys (QWERTY layout). Virtual reality hardware was tested only in a certain `Google Chrome` version from year 2022.
 
  Files `three.js` and `stats.js` are used as provided by their authors in year 2022 (the exact versions are forgotten). All other files are written by me.

  The project is abandoned for more than 2 years and there is no intentions of resuming work on it.
